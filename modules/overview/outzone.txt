You play as a cyborg mercenary hired to stop an alien invasion.

Fight through seven levels filled with enemies, using powerful weapons like a spread gun and all-direction laser.

Collect power-ups to upgrade weapons, refill your energy bar, and discover hidden secrets.

Each level ends with a boss fight, and surviving requires switching weapons strategically and managing your energy.
