A vertically scrolling shoot'em up game.

As enemies are destroyed, the player gains experience points that are separate from the score.

For every 288 experience points gained, the main gun will 'level up', becoming much stronger. 

The weapon can only level up twice, so after it has achieved its maximum level, 288 experience points will grant the player an extra bomb.
