A fast-paced, vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up where you pilot one of six WWII fighter planes.

Blast through waves of enemies with powerful machine guns and bombs across eight stages.

The first four stages are randomly selected, while the last four follow a set order.

Survive long enough to increase difficulty, earn extra lives, and challenge yourself in each new loop!
