# Class of '81 Attract-Mode Layout

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgavril/classof81-layout/refs/heads/main/images/screenshot.png)

This Attract Mode layout replicates the look and functionality of the default interface from Arcade1UP's *Class of '81* cabinet.

## Features

- Configure dip switches from the game config menu.
- Select alternate ROMs (clones) from the game config menu.
- Display [Retro Achievements](https://retroachievements.org/) for each game.
- Show the controls layout when starting a game.

## Limitations

This layout was specifically designed for Arcade1UP's *Class of '81* cabinet and my personal needs. As a result, there are some limitations. Some may change over time, but others are permanent.

- Optimized for arcade games running on RetroArch with FinalBurn Neo.
- Built for [Attract Mode Plus](https://github.com/oomek/attractplus) and will not work with standard Attract Mode.
- Vertical 3/4 layout optimized for 960×1280 resolution.
- Artwork, including the controls layout page, is designed for the *Class of '81* cabinet.
- Designed to run on Linux. Windows and macOS are not a priority, but I'll try to maintain compatibility.
- Dip switches and controls layouts require JSON files. Only a limited set of games are currently supported, but more can be added easily.

## Installation and Configuration

This guide assumes you already have Attract Mode Plus, RetroArch with FBNeo core installed and running.

After copying the theme to the layout folder, you’ll need to adjust some settings in Attract Mode and RetroArch to enable all features.

For detailed instructions, see the wiki page.
